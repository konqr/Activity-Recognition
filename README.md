# Activity Recognition

This repository contains the code for my Project on Human Activity Recognition using RGB-D videos collected from MS-Kinect over four benchmark datasets. We were able to achieve state of the art accuracy by applying Machine Learning Algorithms such as Support Vector Machines on "movement polygons" that we synthesised from the video of the activity to be recognized.
